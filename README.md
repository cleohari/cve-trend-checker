# CVE Trend Checker quick start / README

The CVE Trend Checker is a free, open source tool that me and my friend did when we were doing Graduate Dissertation.
CVE Trend Checker takes CVE report from [Dependency Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) (A Jenkins plugin scanning project vulnerabilities) and fetches to the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD) list of [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#:~:text=Common%20Vulnerabilities%20and%20Exposures%20(CVE)%20is%20a%20dictionary%20of%20common,publicly%20known%20information%20security%20vulnerabilities.) (CVEs) for the CVE information, this tool also crawl from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) to find the top most mentioning CVEs and analyzes, merges and also visualize the data for better understanding.
